      I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
      current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
      got every penny's worth.

      "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been
      looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
      amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
      found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
      weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
      completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as
      a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

      Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
      Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was
      easy.

      "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I
      needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
      programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
      student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
      The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
      hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
      project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
      next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've
      often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
      experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
      developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"
